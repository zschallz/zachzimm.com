					<h3>Description</h3>
                    <hr />
					<p>During my graduate studies (unfinished) I had the opportunity to participate in an open-source project that 
					aimed to create a multi-platform Java application that non-technical users could use to build functional applications 
					visually. This project is on-going and can be used in its alpha stages. I was chosen to work on this project as part 
					of work for a Masters-level Java Design Patterns course at Indiana University by Professor Gregory Rawlins .  I played 
					a major role in redesigning the User Experience of a key functional component of the application, and also assisted 
					with Technical Implementation.</p>
					<p>I worked on this project as a three-man team for two months with two other Java Developers.
					The main goal of this two-month engagement was to redesign and implement a key component of how 
					a user defines the functionality of an application they are creating. We also redesigned much of
					the look-and-feel of the application, as well as identified and documented critical User Experience 
					flaws of the application.</p>
					<p>The result of my participation during this two-month engagement was numerous code
					and design contributions to the existing open-source application, which can be viewed at
					the repository listed above. To see examples of our teamâ€™s work, please see the below videos.</p>
